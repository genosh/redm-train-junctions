# redm-train-junction

## Description
This is script to allow player to switch train junction a sync it with other player.
Train driver can change tracks direction and see where train go on the minimap.

## Features
- Swith junction when player is driving a train
- Visualize direction where goes the train on the minimap
- Sync junction wth all players

## TODO
- Add possibility to switch junction directly at junction tracks (when player is at the ground)

## Installation
- Add `redm-train-junctions` folder to your resources folder
- Add `ensure redm-train-junctions` to your `resources.cfg`
- Restart resource

## Dependencies
- No dependencies and wrote to be used with any other trains scripts.
BUT TAKE NOTE: if other train script use switch junction, this can be make conflict and swith will not be take in consideration by this script. In this case, disable switch junction on other modes.
For example, if you use BCC-trains, allowing switch junction too, you have to disable this feature to grant a good work of both scripts. 

## How to use
- When player is train driver, press `X` to switch junction.
